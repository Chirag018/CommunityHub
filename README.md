interview platform where anyone can come-in and host the interview,
the data/recording of the interview will be stored on filecoin storage/lighthouse, the interview process will be hosted by huddle01/push.
we can even think of having a notification service ?
On top of that having a live coding platform which will be running simultaneously as with the interview.
we can use ens as well, the moment anybody joints with their account, and if they own any ens domain, we can just display that instead of showcasing 


sponsors:

huddle01 - meeting/ interview
push - notification
ens - using ens name, & avatar?
